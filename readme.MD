#### Vulnerabilities
Security issues in the code that could be exploited by attackers (e.g., SQL injection, hard-coded secrets). These represent real security risks.

#### Bugs
Coding errors that may cause incorrect behavior, crashes, or unexpected results at runtime.

#### Code Smells
Maintainability issues that don’t break functionality but make the code harder to read, understand, or modify (e.g., duplicated code, complex methods).

#### Security Rating
Overall score (A–E) indicating the security quality of the code, based mainly on detected vulnerabilities.

#### Maintainability Rating
Score (A–E) representing how easy the code is to maintain, calculated from code smells and technical debt.

#### Code Coverage
Percentage of code executed by automated tests, showing how well the codebase is tested.
